Java concurrency based project
Title:
"Multi-User Bank ATM Simulation using Java Concurrency"

ðŸ“„ Abstract:
This project simulates a real-time ATM environment where multiple users try to access ATM machines to withdraw money concurrently.
Using Java Concurrency tools like ExecutorService, Lock, and Semaphore, we ensure:

Safe access to shared bank balance

Only limited users (2) can access the ATM at the same time

Accurate and thread-safe transactions

This helps in understanding multi-threading, synchronization, and thread coordination in real-time applications.
